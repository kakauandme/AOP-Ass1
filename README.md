========

The purpose of this assignment is for you to learn about the basic programming constructs of BDI agent languages (in particular, Jack), as well as to get started with the Prometheus Design Tool (PDT) to design and develop agent sys- tems. Normally, in building a system one would start with fleshing out the basic ideas of the system - system specifica- tion/requirements/etc. However, we have found in teaching Agent Oriented Programming and Design that students need to have a concrete grasp of the programming constructs, before doing design. Assignment one therefore consists of small programming tasks introducing you to the important programming constructs of agent system development. In order to provide a more cohesive and integrated project experience, we base these tasks on small additions to the core program we provide as a starting point for your major project. The Prometheus Design Tool produces skeleton code, and you will be using this feature in your large project. Consequently we will guide you from the beginning, in introduction of entities at the design level, followed by augmentation of the skeleton code produced, to give an executable program.
